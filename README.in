BUGS AND DEFICIENCIES
    - Need to tune the manufacturer-supplied ICM color profiles to match the
      characteristics of Ghostscript.

    - Need to figure out how to get near-invisible dithering out of Ghostscript
      without affecting the colors.  With GS 7.05, if you set -dDITHERING=150,
      for example, the dithering becomes less visible but you get areas of
      color blotches.  No way to win.

    - Ghostscript 8.0 has worse color dithering compared to 7.05.  The symptom
      is slanted bands separated by 0.5 to 2mm, at a 30 degree angle.

    - Need to support a better input color file format which includes
      explicit page boundary indications.  The current use of the Ghostscript
      "bitcmyk" format precludes having pages of different sizes within a
      Postscript stream.

    - It is not entirely clear whether the JBIG-KIT compression library
      produces compressed data compatible with all implementations of JBIG
      in ZjStream printers.  It is possible that bugs or subtle
      implementation differences might result in incorrect printer behavior.

AUTHORS
    The foo2zjs engine program began life as Robert Szalai's 'pbmtozjs'
    program.  It also uses Markus Kuhn's JBIG-KIT compression library
    (included, but available at http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/jbigkit/),
    and Marti Maria's icc2ps program (included, but also available at
    http://www.littlecms.com).

    The foo2zjs engine was overhauled by Rick Richardson to add color
    support for the Minolta/QMS 2300DL, add command line options, limit
    data chunk size to 65536 bytes, and other miscellaneous features.
    Rick also contributed the zjsdecode program and the foomatic database
    entries for the Minolta/QMS magicolor 2300 DL.

    The foo2* engine was written entirely from scratch by Rick Richardson.

    The latest version of foo2zjs can be found at:
